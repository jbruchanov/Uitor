UITor is a result of my rebranding experiences of one android app what I was working on. Because of the project's complex structure, not using themes, complexity of UI and app itself, it was really hell and time consuming work to finish the app rebranding. Project structure had been done like sub-projects, because of big amount of different assets, logic, etc. I found out also UITor very useful in time of UI refactoring/bugfixing other apps what I didn't know much deeply from UI/structure perspective.
